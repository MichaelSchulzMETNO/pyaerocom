# pyaerocom web processing sub-package

This module contains code for high-level processing of AeroCom data for web visualisation. Currently, this includes processing tools for the [AeroCom evaluation interface](https://aerocom-evaluation.met.no/) and for the [AeroCom trends interface](https://aerocom-trends.met.no/).

## Introduction into processing tools for the AeroCom evaluation interface

In the following, short introduction is provided into the required processing steps for the Aerocom Evaluation interface.

The website is organised into different projects (cf. landing page of above link) and different experiments. Each of the projects has it's own, isolated Evaluation interface. The following examples use the *AeroCom* (pyaerocom ID: *aerocom*) project (top left panel on website) to illustrate the main processing steps (which are fully equivalent). The website of the *AeroCom* project can be reached by clicking the panel:





### Configuration file

The analysis is based on a configuration file containing all observation datasets that are supposed to be considered and
